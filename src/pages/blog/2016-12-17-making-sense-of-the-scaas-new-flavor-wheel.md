## START WITH A VISION

**Do you start things and leave them without going to the end?** Presumably, most of us do this at some point in our life either while studying or trying to do something different.

You know every beginning has an end, the end seems so much beautiful if you start it with a **VISION**.

Visualization is a mental process to create an image or situation in your mind. It is a powerful weapon. It gives you the strength to **start** things with a positive attitude even though there are obstacles in your way.

When you visualize things in your mind, it will not even help you to take a step forward in your life but it will also help you to get success. You know one thing, leaving things in the middle is not the only solution, **you can't easily give up on things if they really matter to you.**

If you feel low, then see front and back by asking yourself why you started it? See yourself  in the situation where you will get it instead of leaving it. Feel the moment feel the joy of getting it. Just feel it with your soul. It will help you to build your confidence.

**BUT learn not to quit never ever. Don't leave the things until you get it.**
